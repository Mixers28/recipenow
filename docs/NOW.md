# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the **current focus / sprint**.  
> It should always describe what we're doing *right now*.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Document baseline context and workflows for the MCP local kit.
- Gather missing project facts (name, owner, stack) so PROJECT_CONTEXT can be populated.
- Queue immediate tasks and deliverables once stakeholders provide inputs.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->
