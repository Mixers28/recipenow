# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the current focus / sprint.
> It should always describe what we're doing right now.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Update docs to reflect the merged persistent agent workflow (memory kit + Codex extension).
- Validate the handoff UI, command wiring, and active agent selection on VS Code stable.
- Ensure Windows support is solid across scripts, paths, and instructions.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Deliver a coherent persistent agent workflow template with accurate docs and a stable Codex handoff extension.

---

## Active Branch

- `main`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [x] Replace MCP framing in docs with the persistent agent workflow source of truth.
- [ ] Document the extension handoff UX (status bar, tree view, commands).
- [ ] Verify command wiring and basic smoke tests on VS Code stable.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- A clear usage section for selecting and handing off to agents.
- A quick validation note or checklist for Windows behavior.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- MCP terminology is deprecated; the new design doc is `docs/PERSISTENT_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.
